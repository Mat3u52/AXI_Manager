# AXI_Manager
AXI Manager: The app is to review the recipes for AXI. AXI Manager collects information about programs for X-Ray inspection like UPH, cycle time, item of the board, amount of the board in panel and etc. The app has the ability to change and remove each record from database. 
I want to thank a lot Beata S. for her great help in creating the icon for AXI_Manager.

2022-10-23 - Recently I have added additional function named like a "automatic add". The function automatically add a new record to database.
